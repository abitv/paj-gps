Otherwise, if you have a GPS vehicle tracker ready in hand, you’ll often have the choice between plugging it into the vehicle's OBD II Port and hardwiring it into the vehicle's battery system. Because they link directly into an OBD-II port, plug-in vehicle trackers don't require any wiring. Hardwired GPS trackers, on the other hand, require a wired connection to the car. Let's take a closer look at how these can be sorted out.

Connect your GPS Tracker to the OBD-ii Port

In most domestic vehicles, many GPS trackers use the vehicle diagnostic port. The OBD-II standard is supported by the vast majority of automobiles, however, some aren't. To find out if they are available see your vehicle's user manual. The OBD-II diagnostic port is usually found underneath the dash on the driver's side of the vehicle. The position of a vehicle or truck model will vary according to the manufacturer, model, and year of manufacturing. For more specific directions, consult the owner's manual for your car.

Before starting the procedure of placing the device, you have to make sure the car is parked on level ground with the ignition turned off. Check whether the device's on/off switch is set to the 'on' position. Now you can connect the gadget to the vehicle's OBD-II port. Turn on the engine and ensure that both the GSM coded Green and GPS coded Blue LED lights on the device flash as they should. You should create an account to monitor the vehicle's activity. To make sure it is working, begin tracking your device on your device.

Hardwire the GPS Tracker

The next option for installing a GPS tracker in a car is to have the device hardwired to the battery, resulting in a covert and out-of-sight car tracking system. A hardwired GPS tracker can also be mounted outside the car. This makes the device even more unobtrusive. The Vehicle tracking device is powered by the car's main battery in this situation. Despite the fact that this is a very straightforward procedure, it is best to have it done by a skilled technician.

If you are familiar with basic automotive work and are confident in your ability to install the device yourself, make sure you carefully follow all of the instructions and test the item after installation to confirm it functions properly. In that scenario, all you have to do is identify your vehicle's battery, connect the wires, and mount the tracker under the hood where you want it. You may begin tracking your vehicle in real-time right away.
